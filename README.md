# Template webpage for starting D3 tutorials

This is a simple template web page to clone for new tutorials and demonstrations.

## Setup

You'll need to download this repo. You can do so by opening the terminal, navigating to a folder where you want to download the file `cd <path/to/your/folder>`, and cloneing the repo `git clone https://github.com/kalealex/d3-template.git`. Alternatively, you can download the repo as a zip file.

You'll want to launch a local server on your machine, so we can develop a visualization offline. Navigate to folder you want to host the website from `cd src`. Then launch a local server using your preferred method. I use php (e.g., `php -S localhost:5555`).
